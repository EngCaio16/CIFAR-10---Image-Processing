# CIFAR-10---Image-Processing

Well, CIFAR-10 can be found at Kaggle. We have 10 categories of images to recognize. By only using CNN and manipulation of layers, I could reach 86,590% of accuracy. When I added image generator, it gave an result close to 86%. In few days, I will update, so, I'll add transfer learning notebook. Those notebooks are part of en exercice of my bootcamp - Nuclio School
